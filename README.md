## Overview

### Purpose

SupplyBoost bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation of distributed systems. While countless resources teach microservices, event-driven architecture, and cloud technologies in isolation, few demonstrate how these patterns work together in a cohesive, production-like system.

**This project aims to:**
- Provide a realistic, non-trivial example of microservices architecture
- Demonstrate modern software engineering practices and patterns
- Serve as a learning platform for developers transitioning to distributed systems
- Showcase the full lifecycle: design → development → deployment → operations

### Target Audience

- **Mid-level developers** seeking hands-on experience with microservices
- **DevOps engineers** exploring containerization and orchestration
- **Architecture enthusiasts** studying system design patterns
- **Students and educators** looking for real-world examples beyond "todo apps"

### What Makes This Different?

Unlike toy applications, SupplyBoost tackles real complexity:
- **Multiple business domains:** Identity, catalog, orders, inventory, payments, shipping, accounting
- **Distributed transactions:** Saga pattern for cross-service workflows
- **Event-driven architecture:** Asynchronous communication via Kafka
- **Production-ready practices:** Monitoring, logging, tracing, security, testing

---

## Architecture

SupplyBoost follows a **microservices architecture** with event-driven patterns.

## FAQ

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: Not yet. This is an educational project. While we follow production best practices, it's designed for learning, not commercial deployment.

**Q: Can I use this for my startup/company?**
A: Yes, under the Apache 2.0 license. However, you'll need significant additional work for true production readiness (security audit, scaling, compliance, etc.).

**Q: Why not just use a monolith?**
A: Monoliths are often the right choice! This project explicitly chooses microservices for **educational value**. See [ADR-001](docs/adr/ADR-001-microservices-architecture.md) for the full reasoning.

**Q: How can I contribute?**
A: Check [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.

**Q: What's the deployment strategy?**
A: Local development uses Docker Compose. Production deployment targets Kubernetes (GKE/EKS/AKS). See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#infrastructure--deployment).
